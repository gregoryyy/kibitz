# DONE

Progress log for [TODO.md](TODO.md), newest first. Each entry gives the date, the TODO items covered, and then:
- **Implementation notes:** what was built, and where.
- **Deviations:** what differs from the plan, and why.
- **Insights:** what we learned that matters for later work.

## 2026-10-20 — Local dev server and justfile

TODO items: none directly; dev tooling that later supports 1.3 and 2.1.

### Implementation notes

- `justfile` at the repo root: `just claude`, `just codex`, `just both`, plus `build`, `test`, `e2e <variant>` and `clean`.
- `scripts/serve.mjs`: a dependency-free Node static server used by the `just` recipes. It sends `charset=utf-8` on every text type, serves only files inside the chosen folder (symlinks included), answers only GET and HEAD, and binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. An `--index` option lets `/` on `claude/dist` serve `_test.html`.

### Deviations

- Local serving moved from `python3 -m http.server` to Node for the `just` recipes, in line with the Node stack. `npm run serve` in `claude/` still uses Python.

### Insights

- Python's `http.server` sends `text/html` without a charset. `claude/dist/index.html` is the bare artifact body with no `<meta charset>`, so Chrome decoded it as Windows-1252 and every `≈`, `…` and `·` came out garbled. `/_test.html` and `codex/` were fine because they declare their charset. Any server we ship should set the charset in the header and not rely on the markup.
- Having our own server makes it easy to add COOP/COEP later, which multi-threaded Stockfish needs (TODO 1.3).

## 2026-10-20 — Planning baseline

TODO items: 5.1 (already done); plan, AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md created.

### Implementation notes

The starting point is a working prototype that runs as a Claude artifact. `claude/` holds its source (npm build into `dist/`); `codex/` is a flat, prebuilt copy. What the prototype already has, marked *(prototype)* in TODO.md:

- Play against Stockfish 19 (WASM, with blob-URL and asm.js fallbacks), with strength set by `UCI_Elo` and a weakened mode below 1320
- A separate full-strength analyst engine (MultiPV 3); engine jobs queued and cancelled by tag
- Lichess-style move classes based on win-% drop, an accuracy score, and an eval graph in the post-game review
- Pure chess knowledge in `knowledge.js`: position features, motif detection, a book catalog with theme retrieval, and similar-position search by EPD and pawn structure
- Coach chat, a review summary and a study plan, all through the Claude artifact runtime (`window.claude.use('sample')`)
- Games library (artifact `db`, falling back to `localStorage`), PGN import and export
- Opening names from the Lichess chess-openings dataset (CC0)
- Mobile layout and dark mode

### Deviations

- **The AI layer moves to a Node server.** The prototype calls Claude only, through the artifact runtime. Supporting several providers means API keys have to live on a server, so TODO milestone 2 adds a Node gateway. The artifact runtime becomes one optional deployment target rather than the base.
- **The scope goes beyond the brief.** Milestones 9 to 12 and the items tagged *(added)* were proposed during planning. Typical examples: output validation, eval sets, the SSRF guard, spaced repetition and accessibility.

### Insights

- `codex/` started as a byte-identical copy of the `claude/` build output: same app code and `knowledge.js`, with chessground CSS inlined. Any difference between the two from here on is new work.
- Multi-threaded Stockfish needs `SharedArrayBuffer`, which needs cross-origin isolation (COOP/COEP headers). That constrains server headers and any third-party embeds, so it should be settled early (TODO 1.3, 2.1).
- Imported PGN comments already flow into the coach prompt. That is an indirect prompt-injection path (TODO 8.7, 11.3.1).
- A user-configurable Ollama base URL lets the server be pointed at internal addresses (SSRF), so it needs an allowlist (TODO 2.12).
- `knowledge.test.mjs` prints results but asserts nothing, so it can't catch regressions (TODO 0.7).
- `.gitignore` patterns containing a slash are anchored to the repo root: `tests/out/` stopped matching after the move to `claude/` (TODO 0.11).
